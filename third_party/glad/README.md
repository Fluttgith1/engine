# Introduction
The `GLAD` library is used for the texture of glfw, which is used to create textures to render RGBA data, and the first version is copied from https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/third_party/glfw/+/999f3556fdd80983b10051746264489f2cb1ef16/deps.

# How to upgrade
`GLAD` can be generated online at https://gen.glad.sh, but upgrading with the `fuchsia/third_party/glfw/deps` copy seems to be more reliable.

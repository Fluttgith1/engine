// This method could just return the results of the math library's
// sin and cos functions but, due to IEEE floating point mantissa
// scaling, the ability to represent numbers close to "1.0" and "-1.0" is
// much more sparse than the ability to represent numbers close to "0.0".
// As a result, this method will check for cases (which happen at the
// quadrant angles of 0,90,180,270 degrees) where one of the pair is
// returning its best answer of 1 or -1 and force the other value to 0.
// This will help avoid "IEEE bit dirt" in transform matrices at quadrant
// angles when trying to represent those angles as irrational numbers
// in a limited-precision floating point world.

/**
 * A class to process key events from Android, passing them to the framework as messages using
 * {@link KeyEventChannel}.
 *
 * <p>A class that sends Android key events to the framework, and re-dispatches those not handled by
 * the framework.
 *
 * <p>Flutter uses asynchronous event handling to avoid blocking the UI thread, but Android requires
 * that events are handled synchronously. So, when a key event is received by Flutter, it tells
 * Android synchronously that the key has been handled so that it won't propagate to other
 * components. Flutter then uses "delayed event synthesis", where it sends the event to the
 * framework, and if the framework responds that it has not handled the event, then this class
 * synthesizes a new event to send to Android, without handling it this time.

  /**
   * Constructor for AndroidKeyProcessor.
   *
   * <p>The view is used as the destination to send the synthesized key to. This means that the the
   * next thing in the focus chain will get the event when the framework returns false from
   * onKeyDown/onKeyUp
   *
   * <p>It is possible that that in the middle of the async round trip, the focus chain could
   * change, and instead of the native widget that was "next" when the event was fired getting the
   * event, it may be the next widget when the event is synthesized that gets it. In practice, this
   * shouldn't be a huge problem, as this is an unlikely occurrence to happen without user input,
   * and it may actually be desired behavior, but it is possible.
   *
   * @param view takes the activity to use for re-dispatching of events that were not handled by the
   *     framework.
   * @param keyEventChannel the event channel to listen to for new key events.
   * @param textInputPlugin a plugin, which, if set, is given key events before the framework is,
   *     and if it has a valid input connection and is accepting text, then it will handle the event
   *     and the framework will not receive it.

   * Applies the given Unicode character in {@code newCharacterCodePoint} to a previously entered

   *
   * <p>This method mutates {@link #combiningCharacter} over time to combine characters.
   *
   * <p>One of the following things happens in this method:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>If no previous {@link #combiningCharacter} exists and the {@code newCharacterCodePoint}
   *       is not a combining character, then {@code newCharacterCodePoint} is returned.
   *   <li>If no previous {@link #combiningCharacter} exists and the {@code newCharacterCodePoint}
   *       is a combining character, then {@code newCharacterCodePoint} is saved as the {@link
   *       #combiningCharacter} and null is returned.
   *   <li>If a previous {@link #combiningCharacter} exists and the {@code newCharacterCodePoint} is
   *       also a combining character, then the {@code newCharacterCodePoint} is combined with the
   *       existing {@link #combiningCharacter} and null is returned.
   *   <li>If a previous {@link #combiningCharacter} exists and the {@code newCharacterCodePoint} is
   *       not a combining character, then the {@link #combiningCharacter} is applied to the regular
   *       {@code newCharacterCodePoint} and the resulting complex character is returned. The {@link
   *       #combiningCharacter} is cleared.
   * </ul>

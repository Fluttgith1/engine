# Hello!
#
# If you find that this gclient hook is failing. You are using a split
# buildroot. This is no longer supported and you must patch you .gclient file
# and update the "name" attribute to point from "src/flutter" to "src". After,
# run `gclient sync -D`.
#
# You will only have to do this once.
